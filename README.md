# web-scraping-llm-tool
Extract relevant data from websites by identifying page structure and useful content using LLMs.

1. Define Project Goals and Scope
Objective: Extract relevant data from websites by identifying page structure and useful content.
Features:
Structure identification: Use LLMs to recognize page layouts (menus, sidebars, main content, etc.).
Interaction simulation: Simulate clicks, form submissions, or logins.
Content filtering: Distinguish useful data from noise (ads, unrelated text, etc.).
2. Setup Your Development Environment
Tools & Libraries:
Python: Primary language.
Selenium: Browser automation for dynamic content and interactions.
Requests: Direct HTTP requests for faster page downloads when interaction isn’t required.
BeautifulSoup (bs4): Parse and navigate the static HTML.
OpenAI (or other LLM API): Use LLMs for semantic understanding and pattern recognition.
Optional: Playwright (alternative to Selenium), Pandas (data manipulation), SQLite (data storage).
3. Install Necessary Libraries
4. Design the Project Architecture
Modules to Create:
Data Collector: Uses Selenium and Requests to load pages.
Content Extractor: Uses BeautifulSoup to extract static content.
LLM Analyzer: Uses LLMs to analyze and label sections of the page.
User Interaction Emulator: Automates clicking, form submissions, and scrolling.
Data Filter: Uses LLMs to separate useful content from noise.
5. Implement Each Component
6. Integrate Components
Create a cohesive system to run all components in a sequence.
7. Logging, Error Handling, and Data Storage
Add logging to track page load times and content extraction.
Implement retries for failed requests.
Store data using SQLite, CSV, or a local JSON file.
8. Advanced Features
Rate Limiting: Respect website rate limits.
Proxy Pooling: Use proxy services for anonymity.
Dynamic Interaction: Handle CAPTCHA using services like Anti-CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA v3 bypass.
LLM Training: Fine-tune a small LLM model to better label page structures for specific site patterns.
9. Test and Debug
Unit Tests: Write unit tests for all functions.
Test Sites: Scrape multiple types of sites (blogs, e-commerce, social media) to validate generalization.
Debug Tools: Use browser dev tools (F12) to analyze page structure.
10. Deployment
Run Locally: Test the script locally with ChromeDriver.
Run on Cloud: Use AWS, GCP, or Heroku to run the scraper.
Task Scheduling: Use cron jobs or Airflow to schedule scraper runs.
